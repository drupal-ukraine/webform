During porting from D7 to D8 there are some points that would be really helpful to follow
in order to work with other contributors during porting timeline.

* Add comments to D7 module copy about some specific part already ported to D8. This can help others
not to interfere with your work.
* Create Change Record at Drupal.org . e.g [for dmaps project](https://www.drupal.org/node/add/changenotice?field_project=2630838) 
about how code was used on D7 and how it should be converted to D8. It can help others to port dependent modules easily.
