For approaching high quality porting it would be nice to start from porting tests if they are available in previous versions of the module.

- There are docs on drupal.org about how-to port tests -> https://www.drupal.org/node/2118119
- It would be nice to start from porting WebTests. UnitTests are not so fittable for porting in terms of D7->D8, because everything is totally changed
